# Installation

## Setting up Raspbian

First of all you must to burn your SD card with Raspbian.

Following the [official guides](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/) you can find many solutions.

I've tried more than one methods and this is my best solution with ***Raspbian Lite*** (without Pixel).

1. [Download Raspbian Lite](https://downloads.raspberrypi.org/raspbian_lite_latest)
2. Uninstall the `.zip` file to get the image file `.img`
3. write the image file to the SD card following the instructions listed on raspberry official site based on your OS:
- for [Linux](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installation/installing-images/linux.md)
- for [Mac OS](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installation/installing-images/mac.md)
    - for [Windows](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installation/installing-images/windows.md)

**ALERT!** Be careful because you must to use `dd` that can be overwrite any partition on your computer.

4. Now you can insert your SD card into RPI, connect monitor, keyboard and mouse and plug to the power for the first access.

**NOTE:** RPI starts automatically plugging the power. If everything works correctly you can see switch on two led lights over the RPI. If only one light is on it probably means that something went wrong installing the OS.

**REMEMBER:** The default `username`:`password` for Raspbian are `pi`:`raspberry`

## Setting up WIFI network

Now you want to connect to your WIFI network. I assume that your network is visible and authenticated with WPA2.

1. Type `sudo iwlist wlan0 scan` to list all available WIFI networks. Look out for network you want to use and copy the `ESSID` value.

2. Edit wpa-supplicant configuration file with `sudo nano /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf` and add these lines at the bottom of file

```
network={
    ssid="The_ESSID"
    psk="Your_wifi_password"
}
```

3. Reboot your system with `sudo reboot` and verify if it has successfully connected using `ifconfig wlan0`.

**NOTE:** if you have other network specs or more instructions try to start from the [official guide](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/configuration/wireless/wireless-cli.md).

## Install VIM and GIT

This point is very simple but really important. To work on your RPI you must to install an editor (VIM) and THE version manager (GIT).

1. type `sudo apt-get install vim git` and wait for the installation.

That's all.

## Install Elixir

1. Install needed packages `sudo apt-get install libssl-dev ncurses-dev m4 unixodbc-dev`
2. Dowload and extract Erlang from erlang.org
```bash
↳$ curl -O http://erlang.org/download/otp_src_19.2.tar.gz
↳$ tar xf otp_src_19.2.tar.gz
```
3. Compile and install Erlang
```bash
↳$ cd otp_src_19.2
↳$ ./configure
↳$ make
↳$ sudo make install
```
4. Download and extract Elixir
```bash
↳$ curl -L -O https://github.com/elixir-lang/elixir/releases/download/v1.4.0/Precompiled.zip
↳$ sudo mkdir -p /opt/elixir/1.4.0
↳$ sudo unzip Precompiled.zip -d /opt/elixir/1.4.0
```
5. Add `/opt/elixir/1.4.0/bin` to your `$PATH`. I've added this line in my `~/.bashrc` file:
```bash
export PATH="/opt/elixir/1.4.0/bin:$PATH"
```

**NOTE:** There is another solution hosted by Erlang Solutions [here](https://www.erlang-solutions.com/resources/download.html).
