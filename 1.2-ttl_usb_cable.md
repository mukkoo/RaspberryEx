# TTL USB cable

I want to use the RPI with my laptop through the USB without connect everytime monitor, keyboard and mouse. To do this i need a **TTL cable** that you can easely find online.

You can read complete guides from: [Adafruit](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruits-raspberry-pi-lesson-5-using-a-console-cable/connect-the-lead) or [Raspberry Workshop](http://workshop.raspberrypiaustralia.com/usb/ttl/connecting/2014/08/31/01-connecting-to-raspberry-pi-via-usb/)

## Enable USB serial

Power on the RPI and, when the Raspbian startup finished, follow this instructions.

1. type `sudo raspi-config`
2. select the option `Advanced options`
3. now select the option `A8 - Serial` and conferm enableling the access with `yes` option
4. Now you can `Finish` and turn off the RPI typing `sudo halt`
5. Disconnect monitor, keyboard and mouse

## Install drivers

Now you must install USB drivers for the cable on your laptop. Here the instructions based on your OS:

- for [Linux](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruits-raspberry-pi-lesson-5-using-a-console-cable/software-installation-linux)
- for [Mac OS](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruits-raspberry-pi-lesson-5-using-a-console-cable/software-installation-mac)
- for [Windows](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruits-raspberry-pi-lesson-5-using-a-console-cable/software-installation-windows)

These images to shown that you can have different cable colors but:

- The **GND cable** (commonly black) on RPI Pin 06 (Ground)
- The **TXD cable** (commonly white) on RPI Pin 08 (TX)
- The **RXD cable** (commonly green) on RPI Pin 10 (RX)


## Enter with terminal

If you are using Mac OSX open the Terminal and type

```bash
↳$ screen /dev/cu.usbserial 115200
```

with Linux is similar

```bash
↳$ sudo screen /dev/ttyUSB0 115200
```

with Windows is more complex but you can follow the [Adafruit guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruits-raspberry-pi-lesson-5-using-a-console-cable/test-and-configure).
